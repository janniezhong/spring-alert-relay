# spring-alert-relay

This project creates a server that takes webhook responses from alert services (such as Runscope, or Ghost Inspector) and consolidates them in a database (as for easier displaying and monitoring in Grafana).


## To Run:

Before running, set up a MySQL database using the script "sql-configure.sql" in the scripts directory. The server should be able to start smoothly from there.
