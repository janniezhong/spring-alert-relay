# spring-alert-relay

This project creates a server that takes webhook responses from alert services (such as Runscope, or Ghost Inspector) and consolidates them in a database (i.e. for easier displaying and monitoring in Grafana). This service aims to relieve the burden of keeping track of many alert services as products and projects get larger and larger. No one wants to have to check 8 different dashboards just to have a general overview of how the application is doing -- 1 should suffice, and this service makes it possible.

### To Run:

Before running, set up a MySQL database using the script `sql-configure.sql` in the scripts directory. The server should be able to start smoothly from there. ************

### How does this work?

This service takes advantage of the fact that most monitoring services allow a user to set up webhook alerts that trigger automatically by running a server that receives these alerts. Once received, the server takes the request body, processes it, and submits it to the database. For more detail on the data flow within the server itself, take a look at the diagram below.

### To add another input monitoring service:

1. Add a new input class that extends the `Input` interface. The only requirement: a constructor that takes in the JSON object, calls the `Input` super constructor, parses the object for the necessary data fields, and sets the fields of the superclass.
2. Add another if-else to the `InputFactory` class, to account for your new input.
3. Add a new `PostMapping` method to the `RelayController` interface that will map to your specific input class.
4. Implement the method in `RelayController` - just return the `process()` method call with the correct factory creation `String` in the method call.

And complete! You've added your own endpoint to this server. 

### To Dockerize

Before containerizing, confirm that the "Beans.xml" file has the correct URL address for the MySQL database that you're running (localhost, 172.17.0.2). If the database is on another container in docker, run 
```
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}â€™ [container_name]
```
to find the IP address.

Then run
```
mvn clean package
docker build -t spring-alert-relay .
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-aert-relay
```
in command line, and you now have a container in Docker running this server!
